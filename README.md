# LibList
LibList is a web application we made for Final Project of Database Programming.
LibList is an accronym from Library List. We made a web application for staff to sorting out the books, like how much books we have now, where is the place, and etc.

We are using Python Flask, HTML, CSS, and MariaDB for this project.
You can install the requirements needed for running the web application.
